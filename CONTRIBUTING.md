## Contributing

Foursquare's Fsq.io repo accepts outside contributions so feel free to send us a pull request.

However, if we decide to accept a patch, we will not merge the pull request through Github.
We will apply the patch internally and republish to Github afterwards.

If you have any questions, please open a Github issue.
